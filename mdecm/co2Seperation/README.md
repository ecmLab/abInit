Membrane technology is of great interest for CO2 capture from syngas and flue gas from fossil fuel-based processes due to its high energy-efficiency, its small footprint, and its ease of operation and maintenance. Enormous flow rates of syngas and flue gas indicate that the cost of the membrane skids will be a significant portion of CO2 capture plants, and thus membrane materials with high gas permeability and good processability for large-scale fabrication are desirable. However, materials with higher gas permeability may exhibit lower gas selectivity, a phenomenon that is often described as permeability/selectivity tradeoff.
Mixed matrix materials (MMMs) comprising inorganic fillers in polymers have been widely explored to overcome the permeability/selectivity tradeoff. The inorganic fillers may have well-defined pore/channel dimensions that fall between the sizes of gas molecules to be separated, resulting in sharp size-sieving ability and thus high gas selectivity. This project aims to provide fundamental understanding of CO2 capture and seperation mechanisms through nanostructured materials (including  graphene, graphene oxide, metal and covalent organic frameworks, etc) by employing molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.
