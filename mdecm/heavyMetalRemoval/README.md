Fundamental understanding of membrane and electrode materials with molecular dynamics simulations
 
Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations offer crucial insights for the understanding of the water transport and heavy-metal ions absorption with different electrode/electrolyte materials during the Floww-electrode Capacitive Deionization (FCDI) processes. MD simulation is employed to study ionic movement and adsorption through/onto a designed membrane and electrode  structures to mimic our FCDI experiments. The membrane is depicted as a single graphene layer with randomly positioned pores, which are functionalized with epoxy functional group at the edges. The activated carbon and carbon black were designed as the electrodes. The membrane simulation is comprised of the single-layer graphene membrane merged into the solution containing heavy-metal ions. The membrane separates the solution into two reservoirs, with the left reservoir contains a water density of 1000g/l, and various heavy metal ions (Ni2+, Ag2+, Zn2+, Cr2+, Cu2+, Pb2+, and Sb3+) with concentrations similar to the values used in our experiment.
