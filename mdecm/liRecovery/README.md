Lithium recovery from black mass using membrane technology is a process that aims to extract lithium from the black mass, a waste material generated during the recycling of lithium-ion batteries. Membrane technology, specifically membrane separation, is employed to selectively separate and recover lithium ions from the complex mixture present in black mass. This project aims to investigate the recovery of Li from black mass in spent lithium batteries, focusing on elements like Ni2+, Co2+, Cu2+, and Mn2+. To achieve this goal, mlecular dynamics simulations are employed to provide fundamental understanding of Li selectivity against black mass through  pure graphene oxide (GO) and functionalized GO@Crown-ether membranes. Owing to the limited theoretical studies on Li recovery from black mass, this project seeks to contribute valuable insights into the field by incorporating a GO-based membrane.

To gain a comprehensive understanding of the Li selectivity across the GO functionalized membrane, we employ three different approaches. Firstly, we design the GO membranes with crown groups at varying ratios, including 1:2 (one GO layer to two 15C5 groups), 1:1 (one GO layer to one 15C5 group), and 1:0 (only GO layer without 15C5 groups). Secondly, we apply various electric currents to the systems, ranging from 0.05 to 1 eV. Additionally, the solutions are prepared with a ratio of 1:1 and 2:1 for Li+/M2+ selectivity.
