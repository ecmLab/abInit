# DFT Plan: Thermodynamic Support for Na3SbS4 Recycling via Hydration-Dehydration

This plan provides DFT-based thermodynamic validation for closed-loop recycling of Na3SbS4 solid electrolyte through reversible hydration-dehydration chemistry. Calculations support experimental recycling work demonstrating recovery of high-performance Na3SbS4 from spent all-solid-state sodium batteries.

## Scope
- **Structures**:
  - Na3SbS4 (anhydrous)
  - Na3SbS4·9H2O (fully hydrated, matches experimental recycling conditions)
  - Na3SbS4·8H2O (intermediate hydrate, from Yaosen Tian et al., Joule 2019)
- **Methods**: VASP/PBE with dispersion corrections (D3), gas-phase chemical potential μ(T,p) for H2O
- **Focus**: Thermodynamic validation of recycling pathway, not interface chemistry

**Note**: The experimental recycling work uses Na3SbS4·9H2O as the fully hydrated form. Our calculations directly model this 9H2O phase (structure from Materials Project). We additionally include the 8H2O intermediate hydrate to explore stepwise hydration pathways and provide insight into the hydration mechanism.

## Research Questions
This theoretical work addresses four key questions that experiments cannot directly answer:

1. **Is recycling thermodynamically reversible?**
   - Can Na3SbS4 hydrate spontaneously to form Na3SbS4·9H2O at ambient conditions?
   - Can Na3SbS4·9H2O dehydrate back to Na3SbS4 under vacuum/heat?

2. **What are optimal dehydration conditions?**
   - What temperature is required for complete water removal from 9H2O?
   - How does vacuum lower the dehydration temperature?

3. **Is hydration stepwise or direct?**
   - Does hydration proceed Na3SbS4 → 8H2O → 9H2O or directly to 9H2O?
   - What are the relative stabilities of 8H2O vs 9H2O under varying humidity?

4. **Does dehydration restore the Na+ conduction framework?**
   - Is the crystal structure fully recovered after dehydration?
   - Are ionic transport pathways preserved?

## Thermodynamic Approach

### Hydration/Dehydration Reactions

**Primary Reactions** (matching experimental recycling conditions with 9H2O):

**Hydration** (dissolution step in recycling):
```
Na3SbS4 (s) + 9 H2O (g) ⇌ Na3SbS4·9H2O (s)
```

**Dehydration** (thermal regeneration step):
```
Na3SbS4·9H2O (s) → Na3SbS4 (s) + 9 H2O (g)
```

**Additional Reactions** (to explore stepwise hydration mechanism):

**Formation of intermediate hydrate**:
```
Na3SbS4 (s) + 8 H2O (g) ⇌ Na3SbS4·8H2O (s)
```

**Conversion between hydrates**:
```
Na3SbS4·8H2O (s) + H2O (g) ⇌ Na3SbS4·9H2O (s)
```

These reactions allow us to determine whether hydration proceeds directly to 9H2O or via the 8H2O intermediate, and to identify the most stable hydrate phase under different environmental conditions (T, RH).

### Free Energy Calculation
- **Solids**: DFT total energies E_DFT(T≈0K) from static calculations
  - At finite T: G_solid(T) ≈ E_DFT + ZPE (zero-point energy, optional)
  - Neglect vibrational entropy for solids (small contribution)

- **Water vapor**: Chemical potential μ_H2O(T, p) = μ°(T) + RT ln(p/p°)
  - μ°(T) from Shomate equations (NIST data, 298-1000 K)
  - p from relative humidity: p_H2O = RH × p_sat(T)
  - p_sat(T) from Antoine or Wagner equation

- **Reaction free energy**:
  ```
  ΔG_rxn(T, RH) = [G_products - G_reactants]
                = [E_solid,products - E_solid,reactants] + n × μ_H2O(T, RH)
  ```

### Inputs
- `30_thermo/energies.yaml`: DFT total energies (eV per formula unit)
- `30_thermo/reactions.yaml`: Stoichiometry of hydration/dehydration reactions
- `30_thermo/utils_thermo.py`: Shomate equations, RH ↔ p_H2O conversions

## Workflow Overview
1. **Structure preparation**: Generate VASP inputs for Na3SbS4 and Na3SbS4·8H2O
2. **DFT calculations**: Relax → static for both structures
3. **Energy extraction**: Collect total energies from OUTCAR files
4. **Thermodynamic analysis**:
   - Calculate ΔG(T, RH) for hydration/dehydration
   - Generate phase diagrams showing stability regions
   - Map experimental recycling conditions onto the diagram
5. **(Optional) Transport**: NEB for Na+ migration barriers to support conductivity interpretation

## Detailed Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Structure Preparation

#### 1.1 Required Structures
**Three structures are needed for complete hydration/dehydration thermodynamics:**

- ✅ **Na3SbS4** (anhydrous) - CIF available in `10_structures/Na3SbS4.cif`
- ✅ **Na3SbS4·8H2O** (intermediate hydrate) - CIF available in `10_structures/Na3SbS4_yaosen.cif`
- ✅ **Na3SbS4·9H2O** (fully hydrated) - CIF available in `10_structures/Na3SbS4_9H2O.cif` (from Materials Project)

**Note**: All structures are now available. The 9H2O structure directly matches the experimental recycling conditions reported in the manuscript. The 8H2O structure provides insight into potential stepwise hydration mechanisms.

#### 1.2 Generate VASP Inputs
Prepare VASP input directories for all three structures:

```bash
cd calculation/20_vasp_inputs

# Anhydrous Na3SbS4
python3 prepare_inputs.py --cif ../10_structures/Na3SbS4.cif --out Na3SbS4

# Intermediate hydrate Na3SbS4·8H2O
python3 prepare_inputs.py --cif ../10_structures/Na3SbS4_yaosen.cif --out Na3SbS4_8H2O

# Fully hydrated Na3SbS4·9H2O
python3 prepare_inputs.py --cif ../10_structures/Na3SbS4_9H2O.cif --out Na3SbS4_9H2O
```

This creates subdirectories:
- `Na3SbS4/relax/` and `Na3SbS4/static/`
- `Na3SbS4_8H2O/relax/` and `Na3SbS4_8H2O/static/`
- `Na3SbS4_9H2O/relax/` and `Na3SbS4_9H2O/static/`

Each contains: POSCAR, KPOINTS, INCAR (from templates), and POTCAR (auto-generated)

#### 1.3 POTCAR Verification
Before submitting jobs, verify POTCAR files exist for all structures:
```bash
ls 20_vasp_inputs/Na3SbS4/relax/POTCAR
ls 20_vasp_inputs/Na3SbS4/static/POTCAR
ls 20_vasp_inputs/Na3SbS4_8H2O/relax/POTCAR
ls 20_vasp_inputs/Na3SbS4_8H2O/static/POTCAR
ls 20_vasp_inputs/Na3SbS4_9H2O/relax/POTCAR
ls 20_vasp_inputs/Na3SbS4_9H2O/static/POTCAR
```

**Required PAW potentials**: Na (or Na_pv), Sb, S, O, H

**Important**: Set `VASP_PSP_DIR` environment variable to your VASP pseudopotential library root (see `POTCAR_MAP.txt`)

---

### Phase 2: VASP Calculations

**Critical**: Always run relaxation before static calculations. The static calculation uses the relaxed geometry (CONTCAR → POSCAR).

#### 2.1 Calculation Sequence

**Step 1: Submit Relaxation Jobs**
```bash
cd calculation/20_vasp_inputs/Na3SbS4/relax
sbatch submit.sh  # or your cluster's job submission command

cd ../../../calculation/20_vasp_inputs/Na3SbS4_8H2O/relax
sbatch submit.sh

cd ../../../calculation/20_vasp_inputs/Na3SbS4_9H2O/relax
sbatch submit.sh
```

**Expected runtime**: 12-24 hours per structure on 32 cores (depending on system size; hydrates may take longer)

**Step 2: Monitor Convergence**
Check `OSZICAR` for convergence:
```bash
tail -n 20 OSZICAR
```

Look for:
- Energy convergence: `dE < 1e-6 eV` between ionic steps
- Force convergence: `RMS force < 0.02 eV/Å`
- Final line should show `reached required accuracy`

**Step 3: Run Static Calculations**
After relaxation converges, copy relaxed structure and run single-point energy:
```bash
cd calculation/20_vasp_inputs/Na3SbS4/static
cp ../relax/CONTCAR POSCAR
sbatch submit.sh

cd ../../../calculation/20_vasp_inputs/Na3SbS4_8H2O/static
cp ../relax/CONTCAR POSCAR
sbatch submit.sh

cd ../../../calculation/20_vasp_inputs/Na3SbS4_9H2O/static
cp ../relax/CONTCAR POSCAR
sbatch submit.sh
```

**Expected runtime**: 1-3 hours per structure

#### 2.2 Troubleshooting

**If relaxation doesn't converge after 100 steps**:
- Check OSZICAR: Is energy oscillating or decreasing?
- Increase NSW to 200 in INCAR
- For hydrate: Ensure D3 dispersion is enabled (IVDW=12)

**If static calculation fails**:
- Verify CONTCAR from relax is valid (not truncated)
- Check that INCAR has NSW=0

#### 2.3 Computational Resources
- **Account**: purewater
- **Partition**: tier3
- **Nodes**: 1 node, 32 CPUs
- **Memory**: 500 MB per CPU (~16 GB total)
- **Time limit**: 48 hours (relax), 4 hours (static)
- **VASP binary**: `vasp_std` (loaded via spack)

---

### Phase 3: Energy Extraction

#### 3.1 Extract Total Energies from OUTCAR
After both static calculations complete, extract DFT total energies:

**Method 1: Manual extraction**
```bash
cd calculation/20_vasp_inputs/Na3SbS4/static
grep "free  energy   TOTEN" OUTCAR | tail -1

cd ../../../calculation/20_vasp_inputs/Na3SbS4_8H2O/static
grep "free  energy   TOTEN" OUTCAR | tail -1

cd ../../../calculation/20_vasp_inputs/Na3SbS4_9H2O/static
grep "free  energy   TOTEN" OUTCAR | tail -1
```

This gives total energy in eV (for the entire unit cell).

**Method 2: Using parse script** (if available)
```bash
cd calculation/30_thermo
python3 parse_energy.py --path ../20_vasp_inputs/Na3SbS4/static
python3 parse_energy.py --path ../20_vasp_inputs/Na3SbS4_8H2O/static
python3 parse_energy.py --path ../20_vasp_inputs/Na3SbS4_9H2O/static
```

#### 3.2 Create energies.yaml
Populate `30_thermo/energies.yaml` with extracted values:

```yaml
# DFT total energies (eV per formula unit)
# Extracted from static/OUTCAR (free energy TOTEN)
# Format: compound_name: energy_value

Na3SbS4: -XX.XXXX       # Replace with your calculated value
Na3SbS4_8H2O: -YY.YYYY  # Replace with your calculated value
Na3SbS4_9H2O: -ZZ.ZZZZ  # Replace with your calculated value
```

**Important notes**:
- Use "free energy TOTEN" from OUTCAR (includes entropy at SIGMA temperature)
- Energy should be per formula unit (Na3SbS4, not per atom)
- If your cell contains multiple formula units, divide by the number of f.u.
- Example: If OUTCAR shows `-234.567 eV` for a cell with 2 f.u. of Na3SbS4, use `-117.284 eV`

---

### Phase 4: Thermodynamic Analysis

This phase addresses the three key research questions outlined in the scope.

#### 4.1 Define Hydration/Dehydration Reactions
Edit `30_thermo/reactions.yaml` to include all key reactions:
```yaml
# Primary reactions matching experimental conditions (9H2O)
hydration_9H2O:
  reactants:
    Na3SbS4: 1
    H2O_gas: 9
  products:
    Na3SbS4_9H2O: 1
  description: "Full hydration of Na3SbS4 (dissolution step in recycling)"

dehydration_9H2O:

    H2O_gas: 1
  products:
    Na3SbS4_9H2O: 1
  description: "Conversion from 8H2O to 9H2O"
```

#### 4.2 Single-Point Test Calculation
Test the calculation at specific conditions:
```bash
cd calculation/30_thermo

# Example: Room temperature, high RH (ambient hydration)
python3 compute_reaction_energies.py \
  --energies energies.yaml \
  --reactions reactions.yaml \
  --T 298 \
  --RH 0.80

# Example: Dehydration conditions (vacuum thermal treatment)
python3 compute_reaction_energies.py \
  --energies energies.yaml \
  --reactions reactions.yaml \
  --T 523 \
  --p_H2O 1e-6  # vacuum: ~10^-6 bar
```

**Expected output**: ΔE and ΔG for hydration/dehydration reactions

#### 4.3 Generate Phase Diagram
Sweep temperature and humidity to map stability regions:

```bash
cd calculation/30_thermo

# Create sweep script
cat > sweep_phase_diagram.sh <<'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
# Sweep T and RH for phase diagram

echo "T_K,RH,p_H2O_bar,deltaG_hydration_eV" > phase_diagram.csv

# Ambient pressure sweep (RH = 0 to 100%)
for T in 298 323 348 373 398 423; do
  for RH in $(seq 0 0.05 1.0); do
    python3 compute_reaction_energies.py \
      --energies energies.yaml \
      --reactions reactions.yaml \
      --T $T --RH $RH >> phase_diagram.csv
  done
done

# Vacuum dehydration sweep (high T, low p_H2O)
for T in 373 423 473 523 573 623; do
  for p_H2O in 1e-8 1e-7 1e-6 1e-5 1e-4 1e-3 1e-2; do
    python3 compute_reaction_energies.py \
      --energies energies.yaml \
      --reactions reactions.yaml \
      --T $T --p_H2O $p_H2O >> phase_diagram.csv
  done
done
EOF

chmod +x sweep_phase_diagram.sh
./sweep_phase_diagram.sh
```

#### 4.4 Key Questions to Answer

**Question 1: Is recycling thermodynamically reversible?**
- Plot ΔG_hydration(9H2O) vs RH at T=298K
  - If ΔG < 0 at high RH (60-80%), hydration to 9H2O is spontaneous → validates dissolution step
- Plot ΔG_dehydration(9H2O) vs T at vacuum (p_H2O ~ 10⁻⁶ bar)
  - If ΔG < 0 at T > 250°C, dehydration is favorable → validates regeneration step

**Question 2: What are optimal dehydration conditions?**
- Determine T_critical where ΔG_dehydration = 0 at different water pressures for 9H2O
- Compare ambient (p_H2O ~ 0.03 bar) vs vacuum (p_H2O ~ 10⁻⁶ bar)
- Show that vacuum lowers required temperature by hundreds of degrees

**Question 3: Is hydration stepwise or direct?**
- Compare ΔG for direct path (Na3SbS4 → 9H2O) vs stepwise (Na3SbS4 → 8H2O → 9H2O)
- Plot stability regions: which hydrate is most stable at different (T, RH)?
- Determine if 8H2O is a stable intermediate or just a metastable phase
- Energy comparison: Is the reaction Na3SbS4 + 8H2O → 8H2O followed by 8H2O + H2O → 9H2O energetically favorable compared to direct Na3SbS4 + 9H2O → 9H2O?

**Question 4: Does structure recover after dehydration?**
- Compare relaxed crystal structures (CONTCAR files) of Na3SbS4, 8H2O, and 9H2O
- Visualize Na+ conduction pathways in all three structures
- Calculate unit cell volume changes upon hydration and dehydration
- Verify that the dehydrated structure matches the original anhydrous phase

---

### Phase 5 (Optional): Na+ Migration Barriers

**Purpose**: Provide theoretical support for the observation that recycled NAS maintains comparable ionic conductivity to pristine material.

**Note**: This is **optional** and **low priority**. The main story (thermodynamic validation of recycling) does not require NEB calculations. Only pursue if:
1. Phases 1-4 are complete and successful
2. Experimentalists specifically request migration barrier data
3. You have computational resources available

#### 5.1 Simplified Approach
Instead of full NEB calculations, consider:

**Option 1: Structural comparison**
- Visualize Na+ sites and pathways in relaxed structures
- Measure Na-Na distances along conduction pathways
- Qualitatively argue that dehydration restores the pathway geometry

**Option 2: Minimal NEB calculation**
- Identify one representative Na1→Na2 hop in Na3SbS4
- Run single NEB calculation (5 images) for the pristine structure
- Compare to literature values (expected ~200-400 meV)
- Note in manuscript: "Migration barrier comparable to literature, consistent with recovered conductivity"

#### 5.2 If You Decide to Run NEB
Use the existing NEB scaffolding in `40_transport/`:
```bash
cd calculation/40_transport
python3 make_neb.py --out neb_Na3SbS4 --images 5
# Follow template in neb_template/README.txt
```

**Expected computational cost**: 48-72 hours on 32 cores for a supercell calculation

---

## Key Assumptions and Limitations

1. **Direct modeling of experimental hydrate**:
   - We now model both Na3SbS4·8H2O and Na3SbS4·9H2O explicitly
   - 9H2O structure from Materials Project directly matches experimental recycling conditions
   - 8H2O structure from Yaosen et al. provides insight into potential intermediate phases
   - This allows us to explore both direct and stepwise hydration mechanisms

2. **Harmonic approximation for solids**:
   - We use static DFT energies (T ≈ 0 K) for solids
   - Neglect vibrational entropy (ΔS_vib ≈ 0 for solids)
   - This is acceptable because water entropy dominates the thermodynamics

3. **Ideal gas for water vapor**:
   - μ_H2O(T, p) calculated using ideal gas + Shomate fits
   - Valid for low pressure range (ambient to vacuum)

4. **PBE functional limitations**:
   - Standard DFE-GGA, good for bulk energetics
   - D3 dispersion captures weak H-bonding in hydrate
   - Does not account for strong correlation effects (unlikely important here)

5. **No kinetic barriers**:
   - Thermodynamic analysis only (ΔG)
   - Does not address kinetics of hydration/dehydration
   - Experiments show process occurs on reasonable timescales → kinetics not limiting
